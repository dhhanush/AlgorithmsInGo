# Algorithms in Go

This repository contains a collection of algorithms implemented in Go. The algorithms are divided into several categories:

- Sorting algorithms
- Searching algorithms
- Graph algorithms

### Sorting algorithms

Sorting algorithms are used to sort a data structure in a specific order. This repository contains the following sorting algorithms:

- Bubble sort
- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
- Quick sort
- Merge sort
- Heap sort

### Searching algorithms

Searching algorithms are used to find an element in a data structure. This repository contains the following searching algorithms:

- Linear search
- Binary search

### Graph algorithms

Graph algorithms are used to solve problems on graphs. This repository contains the following graph algorithms:

- Breadth-first search (BFS)
- Depth-first search (DFS)
- Topological sort
- Minimum spanning tree (MST)
- Shortest path
